# Limtrans ERP Panel

This repository contains a simple ERP panel implemented with Flask. It demonstrates a basic inventory module with the ability to add, edit and delete products.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python -m erp_app.app
```

The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Project Structure

- `erp_app/app.py` – main Flask application.
- `erp_app/templates/` – HTML templates.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

This is a minimal example and does not include authentication or a database. It is intended as a starting point for further development.
